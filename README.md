### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a lifelong maker, a fixer, and an integrator. From leveraging mixed reality to automate my home with Azure Kinect sensors, custom PCBs and software, to retrofitting my car with a custom Linux-based infotainment system merging Android Auto with OBD CAN features, I like making things work.   I am a passionate problem solver at heart, and I want to begin my career of problem solving professionally.
